Inversion of Control
    - In java, when different layers try to communicate, objects have to be created and then we need to manage the whole lifecycle of it.
    - in IOC, we give this responsibility of managing the whole object to someone else
    - IOC is achieved with the help of dependency injection
    - it is a principle

Dependency injection
    - it is a design pattern
    - the spring injects the objects whenever we require it

    - Constructor injection
        public class Controller{
            private Service service;
            public Controller(Service service){
                this.service = service;
            }
        }
    - Field injection
        public class Controller{
            @Autowired
            private Service service;
        }

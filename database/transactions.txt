Isolation levels
1. Dirty reads
    - Transaction T1 reads data that another transaction T2 has not committed yet. If T2 rolls back, T1 read invalid data.
2. Non repeatable read
    - A transaction reads the same row twice and sees different values because another transaction modified it in between.
3. Lost update
    - Two transactions read the same value and both write a new value based on the old value, causing one write to be lost.
4. Phantom reads
    - A transaction re-runs the same query, but new rows suddenly appear (or disappear) due to inserts/updates by other transactions.


COMMIT & ROLLBACK
    - ROLLBACK can only undo work that has NOT been committed yet.
    - Once COMMIT happens, ROLLBACK can no longer touch that data.
    - How ROLLBACK works internally
        Databases maintain undo logs (or rollback segments).
        Before modifying a row:
        DB writes the old value into undo log
        If rollback occurs → DB restores the old versions
        Undo logs also support MVCC (readers see old versions).
    - How COMMIT works internally
        When you commit:
        All changes are written to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL)
        WAL is flushed to durable storage (disk)
        The DB marks the transaction as committed
        Background processes apply changes to actual data pages
